# Classification Repository

## Vocab

- Classifier: An algorithm that maps the input data to a specific category.

- Classification Model: A series of steps that takes the patterns of input variables, generalizes those patterns, and applies them to new data in order to predict the class.

- Feature: A feature, aka input/independent variable, is an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed.

- Binary Classification: Classification with two possible outcomes, e.g. pass/fail.

- Multiclass Classification: Classification with more than two classes, where each sample is assigned to one and only one target label, e.g. Grade levels of students in school (1st-12th).

## Common Classification Algorithms

- K-Nearest Neighbors (sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier)
- Random Forest (sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier)
- Support Vector Machine (sklearn.svm.SVC)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier)
- AdaBoost (sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier)
- Bagging (sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier)
- Gradient Boosting (sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier)
