    "In this exercise, we'll continue working with the titanic dataset and building logistic regression models. Throughout this exercise, be sure you are training, evaluation, and comparing models on the train and validate datasets. The test dataset should only be used for your final model.\n",

    "For all of the models you create, choose a threshold that optimizes for accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bonus3: scikit-learn's LogisticRegression classifier is actually applying a regularization penalty to the coefficients by default. This penalty causes the magnitude of the coefficients in the resulting model to be smaller than they otherwise would be. This value can be modified with the C hyper parameter. Small values of C correspond to a larger penalty, and large values of C correspond to a smaller penalty.\n",
    "Try out the following values for C and note how the coefficients and the model's performance on both the dataset it was trained on and on the validate split are affected.\n",
